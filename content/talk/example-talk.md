abstract = "Apache Spark demonstrated its advantages over Hadoopâ€™s MapReduce computation engine, in terms of both the runtime performance and the broader range of computation workloads that it can handle. In this work, we make two significant contributions to the Spark community: (1) we build a web tool called Sparkling with better execution visualization and statistical analysis. With Sparkling, we are able to identify the task skew problem in a number of biomedical multimedia analytics applications; and (2) we propose two methods to address the unbalanced task execution problem: application-aware data partitioning and greedy (speculative) task scheduling. Our methods improve the execution time of biomedical multimedia analytics applications by up to 20%."
