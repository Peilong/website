abstract = "In our experiments, OVS­DPDK can achieve a maximum of 8x throughput increase compared with vanilla OVS. To understand the performance difference, we leverage advanced profiling tools such as Intel VTune Amplifier and Linux perf [4] to investigate in detail what system architecture parameters are affected by OVS­DPDK for achieving the speedups."
